## üìù Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * ‚ö° `:zap:` when improving performance
    * üêõ `:bug:` when fixing a bug
    * ‚ú® `:sparkles:` when adding a new feature
    * üìù `:memo:` when writing docs
    * üöÄ `:rocket:` when deploying
    * üíÑ `:lipstick:` when updating the UI and style files
    * ‚ôø `:wheelchair:` when improving accessibility
    * üîß `:wrench:` when updating configuration files
    * üö® `:rotating_light:` when removing linter warnings
    * ‚úÖ `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
    * üîí `:lock:` when dealing with security

**Examples:**
```
‚ú® Add dark mode toggle to header
üêõ Fix carousel navigation on mobile
üìù Update installation instructions in README
‚ö° Optimize image loading with lazy loading
```

### TypeScript Styleguide

* Use TypeScript for all new code
* Define proper types, avoid `any`
* Use interfaces for object shapes
* Use type aliases for unions and complex types
* Export types that might be reused

**Example:**
```typescript
// Good
interface ProjectData {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  imageUrl: string;
  tags: string[];
}

const project: ProjectData = {
  // ...
};

// Avoid
const project: any = {
  // ...
};
```

### Component Guidelines

#### File Structure
```typescript
// 1. Imports
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';

// 2. Types/Interfaces
interface MyComponentProps {
  title: string;
  onClick?: () => void;
}

// 3. Component
export function MyComponent({ title, onClick }: MyComponentProps) {
  // 3a. Hooks
  const [state, setState] = useState(false);
  
  // 3b. Handlers
  const handleClick = () => {
    onClick?.();
  };
  
  // 3c. Render
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <Button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Best Practices

* **Component Naming**: Use PascalCase for components
* **Props**: Destructure props in function parameters
* **Event Handlers**: Prefix with `handle` (e.g., `handleClick`)
* **Server Components**: Default to Server Components, use `"use client"` only when needed
* **Accessibility**: Include ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
* **Responsive**: Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop
* **Performance**: Use `React.memo()` for expensive renders

#### Component Checklist
- [ ] TypeScript types defined
- [ ] Responsive on all screen sizes
- [ ] Accessible (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)
- [ ] Follows naming conventions
- [ ] Comments for complex logic
- [ ] No console.logs in production code
- [ ] Handles loading and error states

### CSS/Tailwind Guidelines

* Use Tailwind utility classes instead of custom CSS when possible
* For complex styles, use `@apply` in CSS modules
* Follow mobile-first responsive design
* Use semantic color names from theme
* Maintain consistent spacing scale

**Example:**
```typescript
// Good
<div className="flex flex-col gap-4 md:flex-row md:gap-8">
  <Card className="p-6 hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow">
    {/* content */}
  </Card>
</div>

// Avoid inline styles
<div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '16px' }}>
  {/* content */}
</div>
```

## üîÑ Development Process

### Branch Naming Convention
* `feature/` - New features
* `fix/` - Bug fixes
* `docs/` - Documentation changes
* `refactor/` - Code refactoring
* `style/` - Style changes
* `test/` - Adding or updating tests

**Examples:**
```
feature/add-project-filter
fix/mobile-navigation-bug
docs/update-contributing-guide
refactor/optimize-image-loading
```

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] **Build Success**: `pnpm build` completes without errors
- [ ] **Linting**: `pnpm lint` passes
- [ ] **Browser Testing**: Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- [ ] **Mobile Testing**: Tested on iOS and Android
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile, tablet, desktop
- [ ] **Dark/Light Mode**: Works in both themes
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Screen reader compatible
- [ ] **Performance**: No significant performance degradation
